The idea that we should have any means of computing available in any format on any device might seem unrealistic, but it is however the main idea behind the computational paradigm, Ubiquitous computing, ubicomp for short, that was first termed in this paper by ().
It might have been hard to imagine then just how pervasive computing had become, from smart phones and gadgets to the internet of things (IoT), so lets see how far our bright minds have gotten us this far, and not least how can we gain from it.

First lets talk about the computer itself, what used to be so big it filled rooms became small and affordable enough to be called personal, hence the "personal computer" (PC) was born, and since then end consumers have voted with their money until computers became so small we could put it, a battery and other gadgedt like a phone and camera in our pockets and be rather annoyed if our battery runs our mid-day. This boom in power over price and size had an impact in all fields of computing, and now the average person har (()) devices and we have on average (()) IoT devices, this impressive amount of data has the potential to serve use well. Every day our data is set to work in a myriad of ways, while most of it might be market and add analasys, we do still have things like automatic itinirary reminders for flights, if it only reminded me to give my plants an extra chug of water before I was gone two weeks. It is a hard problem for my email provider to solve, could it share my data, or request my "plant" status (in an ethical sense with regards to privacy), but with open source solutions we own the data, and we can do all those extra little details possible.




And it is, many major commercial companies provide us with smart assistants, reminders and much more, however where a proprietary solution might not have our solution or a good way to interface
