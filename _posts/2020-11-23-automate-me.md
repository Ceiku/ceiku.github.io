The idea that we should have any means of computing available in any format on any device might seem unrealistic, it is however the main idea in Ubiquitous computing paradigm, ubicomp for short, that was first termed in this paper by ().
It might have been hard to imagine then just how pervasive computing had become, from smart phones and gadgets to the internet of things (IoT), so lets see how far our bright minds have gotten us this to this purpose, and what can we take from it.

First lets talk about the computer itself, what used to be so big it filled rooms became small and affordable enough to be called personal, hence the "personal computer" (PC) was born, and since then end consumers have voted with their money until computers became so small we could put it, a battery and other gadgedt like a phone and camera in our pockets and be rather annoyed if our battery runs our mid-day.
In this comparison of units sold in the mobile and desktop market segments between yy we see that the mobile market is far bigger and growing in relative share, the "personal" in PC is dead, end consumers usually opt for specialised work stations or gaming computers. 

With both major mobile OS providing a desktop environment with full keyboard and mouse support there is even less reason for the general user to have a computer, even as a devloper and hobby content creator I have transitioned over to mobile devices and both saved money and gained a range of unexpected features, just having a "laptop" with cellular can give home office during the pandemic a refreshing twist by working with a view.

Just bring a thermos of coffee, some snacks, I even spent a weekend working away from home with just a 10.000 mah portable battery.

And the home office looks clean and has no noisy fans or disks.

At this point it might seem a given that we want to access all out content, even computer games, from any device at any time, with the advent of cloud gaming and remote desktop we can gain access to the full range of desktop functionality anywhere. But unlike streaming a video on youtube these services are interactive, and we become more delay sensitive, distances between us and the computational resource can become an issue, we touch more upon that in a later post about infrastructure.

So if we are already there, why are we talking about it?
This is where we stumble upon proprietary walls, and the single reason why our services are not more ubiquitous. Google as a mail provder can be set up to automatically adjust an itinirary upon recieving a booking confirmation email for a flight, a range of automated services can then take place. It can use its map service to compute estimated depature times from my home or hotel to the airport seamlessly, freeing the users attention from the need of any device or notebook to stay ahead on their trip, it can give travel advises and during the pandemic provide the most recent rules and guidelines too. But these are all part of the google ecosystem, asking my alexa dot to retrieve this itinirary is painstaking if not impossible, of course, with enough agony one might be convinced to create a permanent solution oneself; welcome to the open source communities!

Open source that once could almost be synomous with basement dvelling has seen a huge uprising, what was once just devolopers dedicating their spare time has become a thriving and well maintained ecosystem that live of community funding. It's a special kind of magic that can happen when you group people who thought "No way I'm paying for that, no one should" together, we have services that either replace or blend seemlessly inn with commercial solutions. Using a smart home "hub" that talk openly with both my google and amazon services lets me use them together freely, this has a cascading effect for each new ecosystem we bring into the mix, in addition we safeguard ourselves from having to buy our next phone or computer from the same manufacturer or OS provider. 

So far we have been discussing one side of ubicomp, how to get our content delivered to any kind of device in a format comfortable to their screen realestae, but in the booking to itinirary automatomation we also liberated another important resource, user attention; at no point did our user have to manually enter or interact beyond booking a flight. In general we call any service that works of your generated context for an automation. I, in home automation a useful context is presence, it lets us ask questions such as "is anyone home?" if not we can turn of the lights, start the vacuum cleaner etc, when you leave work you might want to have the temperature and lighting adjusted on your arrival, someone might prefer some music. 


"HA dash"
While I usually refrain from relying on visualizations in my home automation, this dashboard is on a display in the hallway so I can glance at it on my way in and out for some important information: what is the weather like? is the local bus delayed? what chores do I have? additionally it provides some reminders that I for one tend to forget. In my case I prefer this information displayed as part of my environment instead of occupying attention on my primary device with notifications etc, (..Ponte) that has been a researcher of HCI for a long made a comment on 'smart' in devices and assistants:

"When I put a chicken in the oven, it is not smart if all it does is move the temperature and settings to an app on my phone, a smart oven would ask me how well I'd like my chicken, or better yet, already know."

It does not mean that the app interface is useless, it's just not doing anything 'smart' by duplicating functionality, it might be efficient however.


So in conclusion we should now know that in the ubicomp paradigm we try to offer any form of computation on any device where 'it makes sense', in addition that our automations should reward us with spending less user attention. If you're interested in settin up this project, or parts of it, be sure to check out the AutoLife project page.

In the next part we look closer at human computer interface (HCI), and how we live in a world of smart devices and things.
