The idea that we should have any means of computing available in any format on any device might seem unrealistic, it is however the main idea in Ubiquitous computing paradigm, ubicomp for short, that was first termed in this paper by ().
It might have been hard to imagine then just how pervasive computing had become, from smart phones and gadgets to the internet of things (IoT), so lets see how far our bright minds have gotten us this to this purpose, and what can we take from it.

First lets talk about the computer itself, what used to be so big it filled rooms became small and affordable enough to be called personal, hence the "personal computer" (PC) was born, and since then end consumers have voted with their money until computers became so small we could put it, a battery and other gadgedt like a phone and camera in our pockets and be rather annoyed if our battery runs our mid-day.
In this comparison of units sold in the mobile and desktop market segments between yy we see that the mobile market is far bigger and growing in relative share, the "personal" in PC is dead, end consumers usually opt for specialised work stations or gaming computers. 

With both major mobile OS providing a desktop environment with full keyboard and mouse support there is even less reason for the general user to have a computer, even as a devloper and hobby content creator I have transitioned over to mobile devices and both saved money and gained a range of features, just having a "laptop" with cellular can give home office during the pandemic a refreshing twist by working with a view.

By now you probably want to move all your services over to a mobile interface, but lets be real about some limits, in some cases such as gaming we are sending each frame as it is computed over the network to the client device, since the user can interact to change the next frame the quality of the service is dependent on low latancy, longer distances between nodes are a natural cause of higher delays.


The devices are separated mainly on one resource, screen realestate, I have my iPad pro for sketching and with the magic folio doubles as a laptop for all but the heaviest coding sessions, if I need more screen realestate my samsung phone connects by usb-c to a monitor with keyboard and mouse, DeX is by far the smoothest mobile desktop hybrid I have tried, after I tried it I felt comfortable making the transition, read more here.

For most user, 

So it's clear that ubicomp isn't about everyone having a PC

Another way to understand this shift is by considering two resources:
- screen realestate: the size and resolution of an environment (phone vs laptop)
- user attention: the amount of interactivity required by the user



#### So where are all the computers?



It is not that we use less computational resource, we just interact with it differently, by allowing an email provider to automatically set an itinirary upon recieving a booking confirmation email for a flight a range of automated services can take place. It can use its map service to compute estimated depature times from my home or hotel to the airport seamlessly, freeing the users attention from the need of any device or notebook to stay ahead on their trip. The notion of user attention as a resource is important,

while the desktop segment still has a hold on specialised services gaming and advanced creative tools, the "personal" in PC is dead.

 This boom in power over price and size had an impact in all fields of computing, and now the average person har (()) devices and we have on average (()) IoT devices, this impressive amount of data has the potential to provide unprecedented context. Allowing an email provider to automatically set an itinirary upon recieving a booking confirmation email for a flight, it uses its map service to compute estimated depature times from my home or hotel address seamlessly, freeing the users attention from the need of any device or notebook to stay ahead on their trip. While it is an impressive use of context, other mail providers have equally context aware features, but they differ based on their proprietary ecosystem. Besides automations such as the itinirary example, general computing software and files have historically been incompatible and in constant rivalry, often to the loss of end users (ms office vs apple works?), cloud document suites have long since made that notion obsolete, more recent examples is the IoT and cloud standards. This level of computation reached ubiquity, which is not saying that we comfortably edit excel sheets on our smartwatch, but devices with adequate screen realestate and peripherals (touch is often enough for light editing, keyboard and mouse otherwise) all present the relatively the same features.

In this comparison of units sold in the mobile and desktop market segments between yy we see that the mobile market is far bigger and growing in relative share, while the desktop segment still has a hold on specialised services gaming and advanced creative tools, the "personal" in PC is dead.
We still use just as much computational resource, just "distributed" differently
This is not saying our need for computational resource isn't as large and growing, but the way we digest and interact with them have changed,
