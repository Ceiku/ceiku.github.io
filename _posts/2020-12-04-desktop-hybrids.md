Computers are expensive, our budget is split over mobile and desktop devices to provide us with comfortable interfaces for our needs, from working on documents or 3D files, or entertainment with games and binging series. On a limited budget getting the features we want become hard, and we might wish that our tablet and laptop was reduced to one device.

This is where mobile desktop hybrids enter the market, and combined with distributed computing we can for the most part have our services and data on any device, any where. This has meant that users on a low budget has been edging for more ways to use their phones and tablets, with periphiral support for mouse and keyboard we come a long way to provide the same comfort in editing larger documents etc as a desktop. Besides 'everyday' computing, the computer is a tool with a lot of specialized hardware and software for advanded data manipulation, they also provide a windowed experience that can stretch over any and multiple monitors.

This has changed a lot, and with a little bit of McGyver magic they are hardly distinguishable.
To help this story along, I will use my own transistion as a lecturer, coder (anything from micro controllers to machine learning) and the content creation I do on my spare time (record and jam sessions, green screen video and 3D modelling) from being platform dependent to independent.

I had a desktop with a dedicated GPU that I got mainly for gaming, but the GPU quickly found other uses too, it was a mid-range computer with enough power to pull 

In my long list of devices I had a stationary that was my trusted mid range gaming rig, a mid range android phone and an iPad mini for garageband and movies while out and about. As I started my degree I also got a macbook pro, flash forward about five years, to 2020 I had to provide my students with online classes, with math and physics, a proper whiteboard is essential; so I got an iPad pro with the pen.

The new iPad quickly became a stable tool in my creative workflows, sketching and 3D modelling became a breeze, but I started to feel encumbered by my devices. The few days I still had at the office or lab required me to bring two devices, nearly the same dimensions to and from work, I also had to unlock and switch focus between devices (luxury problems), and files still had to be synchronized between them too.

At home I had even more devices to switch between, from gaming, to just checking a few notifications on social media, I felt split between devices to charge, or that was plugged into the wall. So I had my first moment of stubborn appiphanies, 'why not just run the stationary as a server?': no more file synching, no more device juggling.  


So lets look at this problem with a hands on case, mine, I had a mid range desktop for gaming, a laptop for education and work,
